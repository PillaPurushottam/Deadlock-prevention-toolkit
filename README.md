# Deadlock-prevention-toolkit
Deadlock Detection and Prevention Toolkit is a lightweight, web-based application designed to help users understand and identify deadlocks in operating systems. Using the Banker's Algorithm, the tool detects whether a system is in a safe or deadlocked state and provides a safe sequence if possible. It also offers theoretical strategies to prevent deadlocks, such as avoiding hold-and-wait, circular wait, and enabling resource preemption. Built with Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, the tool offers a simple and interactive interface for both students and educators. It serves as a practical resource to complement theoretical knowledge of process synchronization and resource allocation.
